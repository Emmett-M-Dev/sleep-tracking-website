How to use and run Sleep.io
1. Install XAMPP
 - this is what I used to host and run SLeep.io
 - I used this link: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
2.Place the Project Folder (Sleep-Tracking-Website folder)
 - After installation, locate the htdocs directory within the XAMPP installation folder.
   This was my file path (C:\xampp\htdocs), place/copy the folder in here.
3.Start XAMPP
 - Open the XAMPP Control Panel.
 - Start the Apache and MySQL services. These services need to be running to access your local server and database.
4. Set up Database
 - Access the XAMPP MySQL database via the phpMyAdmin interface by going to http://localhost/phpmyadmin in your web browser.
 - Create a new database . The name of the database should be emurray46.
 - Username: By default, XAMPP uses 'root'.
 - Password: XAMPP has no password set for MySQL by default.
 - the database file is in the Sleep-Tracking-Website zip folder
 - import this into mySQL.
5. Run Project locally 
 - use this link: http://localhost/sleep-tracking-website/pages/registration.php
 - this will be the first page to register and enter.
